# Interpreter for ARITH language

-------------------------------------------------------------------
HW1- ARITH: lexer.h, parser.h, ast.h, main.cpp, Makefile

Authors: Rangasri Chakravarthy & Priyanka Dutta

On this homework, we worked together for 10 hours,

Rangasri worked independently for 2 hours,
Priyanka worked independently for 2 hours.
--------------------------------------------------------------------
This project was implemented in c++.

Steps to compile:

Steps to run:
- ./arith

Steps to run the tests:
- ./test.sh

Arith operations implemented:

+ (ADD), - (SUB), * (MUL), / (DIV)

Extra features added:

% (MOD), skipping extra spaces (even if there is more than 1 space between numbers and operands)

Extra test cases:

10 extra test cases have been added to support the extra features and are under 'self.bats'

    Initial commit


Note: 

Since we were not sure if we can maintain a public git repo (since the course is ongoing), 
we were pair programming and then we pushed the code to our own private git repositories
(since we could not collaborate on private repo on GitHub).
